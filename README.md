# 🍽 Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** based Machine Learning application that classifies restaurant reviews as **Positive** or **Negative**.

The model is trained using **TF-IDF vectorization** and a **Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier, and presented as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- TF-IDF Vectorizer  
- LinearSVC (SVM)  
- Streamlit (for interactive interface)

---

## 🧠 NLP Techniques Used

- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal)  
- Stopword removal  
- Bag of Words representation  
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)  
- Supervised Text Classification using Support Vector Machine

## 📂 Dataset

- **Restaurant_Reviews.tsv**  
- 1000 labeled restaurant reviews  

Target labels:
- `1` → Positive Review  
- `0` → Negative Review

## ⚙️ Model Workflow

1. Load dataset  
2. Perform text preprocessing  
3. Split data into training and testing sets (80-20)  
4. Apply TF-IDF vectorization  
5. Train model using LinearSVC  
6. Evaluate model performance  
7. Save trained model (`.pkl` file)  
8. Build interactive UI using Streamlit
